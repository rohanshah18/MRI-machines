This repository contains my undergraduate research work on Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging machines, which was funded by National Science Foundation and College of Engineering, at The Pennsylvania State University. 

Objective:
The aim of the research was to enable magnetic resonance imaging using low-cost, low maintenance powered magnets. The specific goal of this project was to compare the performance of Flux regulation and Follow B techniques, which facilitates MR imaging in powered magnets.

Importance of research:
To reduce the cost of MR systems by replacing the low temperature superconducting magnets with powered magnets. The reason for replacing them is first, they are expensive to set up, since the coils are supposed to be maintained at low temperatures by using cryogenic liquids. Meanwhile, the low temperature superconducting magnets are large and they require special vents to get rid of boiling helium liquid. Lastly, by replacing the low temperature superconducting magnets with permanent or powered magnets will get rid of any risks involved in the handling of cryogens. Therefore, a permanent or powered magnet in a MR system will make the MR imaging scanner best suitable for the hospital clinics and increase the use for medical purposes.
